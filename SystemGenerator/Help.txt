===== HELP FILE =====

This file provides explanations for the information presented by this tool, and how to use the tool.
When you first stat the program it will take a minute to load, and will then present you with a randomly-generated classical solar system.
On the left side, you will see the generate system button, system list, and the satellite list. On the right side will be four boxes list-
ing various properties of the selected object. In the middle is an image of the selected object, and on the bottom is some flavor text.

=== The UI ===

--- Image ---

The centerpiece of the UI is a procedurally-generated image of the selected object, based on both the randomly generated and calculated
properties of the object. In the bottom-left corner is a scale indicator; this scale is in pixels per kilometer.

--- The System List ---

The system list shows all of the notable objects in the system, starting with the star and moving outward. The list can be navigated with
the W and S keys.

--- The Satellite List ---

The satellite list shows all of the satellites orbiting the selected object, starting with the closest one and moving outward. The list
can be navigated with the A and D keys.

--- Physical Properties ---

The physical properties box shows statistics concerning the size and appearance of the selected object.
For stars,   these properties are: mass, radius, gravity, escape velocity, metallicity (proportion of elements heavier than helium), and
	expected lifetime.
For planets and moons, these properties are: mass, radius, gravity, escape velocity, temperature, and albedo (reflectivity).
For asteroid belts, these properties are: total mass, width (range of orbital radii), height (range of orbital inclination), and average
	albedo.

--- Bulk Composition ---

The bulk composition box only shows for planets and moons, and shows approximately how much of the object's total mass is made of rock,
metal and metal ore, volatile ices like frozen ammonia, methane, carbon dioxide and other similar material, water, and period-1 elements
like hydrogen, deuterium, tritium, and helium. This information is then used to calculate the average density of the object.

--- Radiance ---

The radiance box only shows for stars, and shows details about the star's luminous output. These details are:
	- Luminosity: the amount of power outputted by the star
	- Effective Temperature: the temperature of an idealized blackbody with the same luminous power
	- B-V Index: a non-dimensional number describing the star's color based on its temperature
	- Absolute Magnitude: a non-dimensional measure of brightness on a logarithmic scale, as viewed from 10 parsecs away
	- Relative Magnitude: a non-dimensional measure of brightness on a logarithmic scale, as viewed from the habitable planet

--- Asteroid Composition ---

The asteroid composition box only shows for belts, and is the asteroid belt version of the bulk composition box. It shows the proportion
of different kinds of asteroids in the belt: s-type (primarily made of silicon), m-type (metallic), c-type (primarily made of carbon
compounds), and i-type (comet nuclei with high proportions of ices).

--- Atmospheric Properties ---

The atmospheric properties shows the composition of the selected object's atmosphere, if it has one. The five most abundant substances
are shown with their relative abundances. This determines the average molar mass of the atmosphere, which is used to calculated the
surface pressure and the scale height - the altitude at which the atmospheric pressure drops to 1/e times the surface pressure. Since
giant planets have no surface to exert pressure on, the surface pressure statistic remains fixed at 1 bar.

--- Orbital Motion (Planets) ---

The orbital motion box for planets and moons describes the parameters of the selected object's orbit, as wel as other parameters of
orientation and motion. The five parameters required to rigorously define the path of an orbiting body are:
	- Semi-major axis: The average distance from the orbited object over the whole orbit.
	- Eccentricity:    The orbit's deviation from a perfect circle. Higher percentages represent ellipses with more extreme aspect ratios.
	- Inclination:     The angle between the plane of the orbit and the ecliptic plane defined by the habitable planet's orbit.
	- Longitude of the Ascending Node: The angle, in the ecliptic plane, between the ascending node of the orbit (the point at which the
		planet crosses through the ecliptic from below) and the habitable planet's apse line (the line formed by the points closest and
		farthest away from the sun).
	- Argument of Periapsis: The angle, in the orbit's own plane, between the ascending node and the periapsis (the point closest to the
		sun).

--- Orbital Motion (Belts) ---

The orbital motion box for asteroid belts shows the average day length, year length, and orbital velocity; calculated based on the middle
of the belt. The orbital parameters of each asteroid are modelled as normally distributed over the width of the belt, and the mean and
standard deviation are givne for each parameter.

--- Orbital Motion (Stars) ---

The orbital motion box for stars shows how long the star takes to orbit th center of the galaxy. It also shows three zones around the star:
	- Formation Zone:  the minimum and maximum orbital distances of planets.
	- Goldilocks Zone: the minimum and maximum orbital distances of habitable planets.
	- Frost Line: the point at which planets switch from small, rocky bodies to giant planets.

=== Generation ===

--- Types of Planets ---

There are several types of planets that the tool can generate:
	- Mercurical planet: a small, dense metallic world like Mercury. These form close to the star and taper off quickly, and never have
		atmospheres.
	- Terrestrial planet: a primarily rocky desert world like Venus or Mars. These can form anywhere in the inner system, and can have
		atmospheres but not water.
	- Ocean planet: a world whose water content makes up an appreciable fraction of the planet's mass. They form close to the frost line
		on the inner side, as volatile ices are rare in the inner system. They can support atmospheres.
	- Habitable planet: can be either a terrestrial planet with some liquid water or an ocean planet. Every system is guaranteed to have
		exactly one, and they always have one large major moon and an atmosphere.
	- Gas giant: A planet made primarily of hydrogen and helium, with a gradual transition to supercritical hydrogen instead of a solid
		surface. They are much larger than the solid planets and spin much faster, and all have the same type of atmosphere.
	- Hot gas giants: Hot gas giants form at the frost line and then move inward to the closest orbit. If the gas giant moves, it will
		prevent an inner asteroid belt from forming.
	- Ice giant: A planet with a three-way split between hydrogen/helium, icy volatiles, and solid silicates and metals. Larger than
		solid planets but smaller than gas giants, they form in the outer reaches of the system and have gas giant atmospheres.
	- Gas dwarf: The smaller cousins of ice giants with less hydrogen/helium compared to their solid mass; they form under approximately
		the same conditions.
	- Asteroid belt: an abnormally high number of small bodies in a location where a planet would be expected. Only two can form per system:
		one immediately inside the frost line, and one outside the most distant giant. Both can have dwarf planets within, but inner belts'
		dwarfs cannot have moons.

--- Types of Atmospheres ---

Atmospheres in this program are divided into "major classes" and "minor classes", based on https://www.orionsarm.com/eg-article/5e724eb65b934
Minor classes correspond to the "Aerosols" section, and are used to determine the aesthetics of the planet like atmospheric color.
Major classes correspond to the "Atmospheric Composition" section, and are used to determine the actual chemical composition. There are six
major classes (Hephaestian is not included, as it is outside the temperature range that this program generates):
	- Jotunnian: the hydrogen-dominated atmospheres of giant planets. It contains:
		First  component: Hydrogen (guaranteed)
		Second component: Helium (guaranteed)
		Third  component: 
			Likely:   Methane, Ethane, Diacetylene, Propyne
			Unlikely: Methylene, Ethylene, Acetylene, Propane
